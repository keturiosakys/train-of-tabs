Track your train of ~thought~ tabs.

A scenario:
1. You open a whole bunch of tabs
2. You switch to something else (another application or you go make some tea)
3. You come back to the browser and wonder: what was I intending to do? Where did this tab come from? Which tabs are the links I was gonna follow up from here?

This is a simple extension that helps with these questions. It keeps track of which links you opened from which tabs. However, instead of showing you a deeply nested hierarchical tab tree that is hard to navigate, you're given a very simple interface where you're shown at most 3 type of items:
- the current tab
- the origin tab (that spawned this current tab)
- the descendant tabs that this current tab opened

> **Note:**
> Currently works only in Chrome (and Chromium based browsers)
